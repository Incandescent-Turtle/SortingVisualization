Program Outline:

VisualSortingTool is the main class and provides access to everything

VisualComponents (VCs) hold an int value, these are what get sorted as numbers

Sorters hold arrays of VisualComponents, and use Visualizers to draw the VCs to the screen
add these to the program via the VisualSortingTool constructor

Algorithms use the current Sorter's VC array and sort it, animating the process
