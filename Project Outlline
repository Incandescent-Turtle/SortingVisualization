Program Outline:

VisualSortingTool is the main class and provides access to everything

VisualComponents (VCs) hold an int value, these are what get sorted as numbers

Sorters hold arrays of VisualComponents, and use Visualizers to draw the VCs to the screen
add these to the program via the VisualSortingTool constructor

Algorithms use the current Sorter's VC array and sort it, animating the process

To make a sorter: 
	if its data is random, override reload and put the code to fill the array there
	if it loads data from a file or something, override generateValues(), this will only ever be run once
	if the data is re-sizeable override resizeArray()
