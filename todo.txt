Weird confirmation color glitch thing

Vital: info on the sort!
-total loops
-total


tool tips!
        ToolTipManager.sharedInstance().setEnabled(true);


- instead of using highlights reset after every component draw!
sorter method or smthn idk. color gradient does that currently. after one thing is drawn it just resets-
its own highlight...
