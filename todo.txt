sound effects #why though? seems like useless settings etc and just doesnt add much?

#not really sure about this one, but there are ways to record video etc maybe? user could just use built in
Screenshot button

#yeah this needs to get done
-file reading support (FileSorter)
-new VC for images (allow image resizing) (scaled instance so you can enlarge it)
-customization option for lowering quality (?) if not a thing could make own funtion with average color groups
-preferences saved on image quality, and file location
#genius idea at 2am lets gooooooooooooooo
-SORT IMAGE IS ONE OPTION AND YOU CAN CYCLE HOW YOU WANNA SORT WITH A SPINNER OR SMTHN
-so customization option for hue, brightness, red, blue, etc

-if no VALID file selected, promt user immidienelty for file location respecting min file/element size
-if there is a valid folder/file, load it up, and have File: as a customization option



#bruh this the whole point
add more algorithms
