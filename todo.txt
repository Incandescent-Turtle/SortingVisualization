sound effects #why though? seems like useless settings etc and just doesnt add much?

#not really sure about this one, but there are ways to record video etc maybe? user could just use built in
Screenshot button

#image sorting
-figure out how to handle nulls
-progress bar loading
-figure out thread stuff - background loading (disable UI while loading?)
-implement different sorting methods (SORT IMAGE IS ONE OPTION AND YOU CAN CYCLE HOW YOU WANNA SORT WITH A SPINNER OR SMTHN, so customization option for hue, brightness, red, blue, etc
-customization option for lowering quality (?) if not a thing could make own funtion with average color groups
-preferences saved on image quality, and file location

-if no VALID file selected, promt user immidienelty for file location respecting min file/element size
-if there is a valid folder/file, load it up, and have File: as a customization option
-choose multiple folders
-add storage for folders


#bruh this the whole point
add more algorithms

Refactor dumbassery that is the constructor for VisualSortingGroup cause every time you implement smthn new you gotta jump through mf hoops to get it all mf sorted

Add sounds

Weird confirmation color glitch thing

Repeat button? üëÄüëÄ blue gradient on 0 delay actually looks kinda sick

Vital: info on the sort!
-total loops
-total

Supplier interface instead of retrieve
Consumer instead of onAction

Search sub folders
Max amount of photos (cut off at 200 or smthn)

For image sorting reset highlights with NULL values

~~FOR FITTING MAX IMAGES ON ONE LINE~~
ImageVisualizer:

drawArray {

//includes gaps and margins
int currentRowX;
int rowNum;

drawImage(img, currentRowX, rowNum)
currentRowX += gap + img.width
if(x+gap+componentSize is out of bounds)
rowNum++;
currentRow.clear();
}
(Different row sizes)

Knock full size resolution down to preserve memory

Don‚Äôt change order when switching image sorting methods

new Visualizer to sort coloured squares (fixed size)

Resizing progress bar

Group loading images and creating VCs into one action (looping twice)

Resizing etc in a separate thread ? Window going full screen is weird

JDialog doesn‚Äôt appear when you select a new folder

Running on separate thread (?), checking mouse position, when hovering over a component displays the description text.

class Descriptions {
Map<JComponent, String> map;

onMouseMove() {

for(every component) {
if(mouse.intersects(component.getBounds()) {
display(map.get(component));
}
}

}

display(String are) {
//uses multi-line parsing from Util to display the descriptions, fitting to the allowed size
}

public static addComponent(JComponent c, File file) {
map.add(c, loadDesc(file);
}

String loadDesc(File file) {
//loads the text from file and returns it
}
}

JButtom shuffle = new JButton(‚ÄúShuffle‚Äù);
Descriptions.addComponent(shuffle, new File(‚Äú/desc/shuffle-button.txt‚Äù);
uses bounding box to display description

thumnails?
