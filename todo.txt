-figure out when to promt user for folder location and how to handle nulls
-progress bar loading
-figure out thread stuff
-figure out loading
-implement different sorting methods (SORT IMAGE IS ONE OPTION AND YOU CAN CYCLE HOW YOU WANNA SORT WITH A SPINNER OR SMTHN, so customization option for hue, brightness, red, blue, etc
-customization option for lowering quality (?) if not a thing could make own funtion with average color groups
-preferences saved on image quality, and file location

-if no VALID file selected, promt user immidienelty for file location respecting min file/element size
-if there is a valid folder/file, load it up, and have File: as a customization option
-choose multiple folders
-add storage for folders
